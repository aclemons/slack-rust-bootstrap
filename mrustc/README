mrustc - alternative rust compiler

This project is an attempt at creating a simple rust compiler in C++, with the
ultimate goal of being a separate re-implementation.

This slackbuild will build and package mrustc and additionally build the
official rust 1.19.0 with stdlib.

This script may take a while to complete (around one hour on a 10 core machine)
and will require about 19GB (!) of disk space for its temporary directory. It
defaults to "/tmp/SBo" and you may redefine it like this:

TMP=/your/temporary/dir ./mrustc.SlackBuild
