Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast,
prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Cargo - the Rust package manager - is included in this build.

This will build rust from source, which requires using the "official" stage0
compiler for the version being built from rust-lang.org, which is currently
the previous stable version.

If you already have rust installed, this slackbuild will use it to bootstrap
itself.

You can also force either behaviour through the LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=yes|no
parameter.

  LOCAL_BOOTSTRAP=no ./rust.SlackBuild
